## Summary

Adds stub methods for Avatar Scaling

<!-- truncate -->

### Changes
- Added methods to handle calls to Avatar Scaling from Udon, so they wouldn't log errors in the console or throw exceptions. Fixes [#98](https://github.com/vrchat-community/ClientSim/issues/98) and [#101](https://github.com/vrchat-community/ClientSim/issues/101).

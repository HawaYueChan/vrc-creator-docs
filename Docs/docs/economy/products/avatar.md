# Avatar Product


import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification-avm.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

This page explains how to configure your [avatar's properties](#create-an-avatar) and create an [avatar product](#create-an-avatar-product).

Avatar products allow you to give users avatars when they buy a [listing](/economy/listings) from you. Each avatar product is associated with one of your uploaded avatars.


After you publish your avatar product, users can discover it in several places:
- The [avatar marketplace](/economy/store/avatar-marketplace) contains all avatar products published in any of your listings.
- Your [world store](/economy/store/world-store) (if you have one) can sell permanent listings containing avatar products.
- Users can access details page of avatar products from various other places in VRChat's menu. For example, users can select other users and press the "Open Avatar Details" button.

## Create an Avatar

Before you can create an avatar product, you must upload an [avatar](/avatars/) in Unity and configure its [details](#avatar-details) on the VRChat website.

:::info

If this is your first time creating an avatar, learn how to [create your first avatar](/avatars/creating-your-first-avatar).

:::

After uploading your avatar, you can find it on the VRChat website in [My Avatars](https://vrchat.com/home/avatars) and configure its [details](#avatar-details).

### Avatar Details

Avatar details give users additional information about your avatar. They help users find and buy your [avatar product](#create-an-avatar-product). 

Open [my Avatars](https://vrchat.com/home/avatars) and click the "‚úèÔ∏è" icon to edit your avatar's details. Most details are optional and you can change them at any time.

:::info
If you list multiple variants of the same avatar as separate products, please give them thoughtful and descriptive names.
:::

| Detail | Type | Limitations |
| - | - | - |
| Name | Text |Up to 64 characters |
| Description | Text | Up to 256 characters |
| Thumbnail | Image | Between 64x64 and 2048x2048 px, 1:1 aspect ratio, up to 10 MB |

When users view your avatar product, they can also see automatically generated details, such as its [performance rank](/avatars/avatar-performance-ranking-system), [platforms](/platforms/), and file size. They also see a list of all listings that contain the avatar product, making it easy to buy the avatar immediately.

After creating an avatar and editing its details, you can create an [avatar product](#create-an-avatar-product).

### Avatar Styles

You can choose a primary style and a secondary style in your [avatar details](#avatar-details). Styles are optional, but they help buyers find the types of avatars they are interested in.

You can choose between the following styles:

- **Animal**: Animal-inspired avatars
- **Anime**: Avatars inspired by Japanese stylistic conventions
- **Cartoon**: Avatars with a stylized or toon-shaded aesthetic
- **Fantasy**: Avatars inspired by dragons, fairies, elves, and other mythical beings
- **Fashion**: Stylishly dressed avatars
- **Furry**: Anthropomorphic animal-inspired avatars and/or avatars associated with furry fandoms
- **Human**: Avatars that resemble people
- **Objects**: Inanimate avatars (appliances, food, shapes, vehicles, etc.)
- **Pop Culture**: Avatars inspired by content that appeals to a mass audience
- **Realistic**: Avatars rendered in a style that is representative of the natural world
- **Sci-Fi**: Futuristic, robotic, cybernetic or alien avatars

You cannot choose the same primary and secondary style. For example, you can't choose "Anime" and "Anime" twice.

If you don't want to set either a primary or secondary style, choose "Not Specified" instead.

## Update an Avatar Product

If you want to improve or update your avatar, you can edit it in Unity and upload a new version (using the same avatar ID).

When you upload a new version an avatar product, you must wait 1-2 business days for VRChat's approval. Afterwards, the update is automatically published.

While waiting for approval, users can continue buying and using the previously approved version of your avatar. When VRChat approves the new version, all owners see the new version instead.

While waiting for approval, you can continue uploading newer versions of your avatar. If you upload multiple versions in a short period of time, VRChat only reviews the latest version, ignoring older versions.

## Avatar content guidelines

Your avatar must meet VRChat's marketplace standards and Terms and Conditions. Our reviewers verify performance, compatibility, and eligibility.

:::warning

The avatar content guidelines may change rapidly while the avatar marketplace is still in development.

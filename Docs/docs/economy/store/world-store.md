# World Stores

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

World stores allow you to showcase [listings](/economy/listings) for your world. After creating a world store, users will see it when viewing your world in the VRChat menu or website.

You can also use Udon to open your world store. For example, you can add an "Open Store" button that uses the `Store.OpenWorldStorePage()` method to open your store.
## Create and publish a world store

You can create a world store for any of your worlds by following the steps below:

1. Open the [Store Manager](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/stores) on the VRChat website (Marketplace >My Store > Store Manager).
2. Click "Set Up New Store"

4. Add published [listings](/economy/listings) to your world store.

## Limitations

Keep the following restrictions in mind when using world stores:

- You can sell the same listing to multiple world stores.
	- You can sell listings that give users benefits in multiple worlds.
	- Users can't buy the same listing if they already own it.
- You can sell [permanent](/economy/listings#permanent) or [temporary](/economy/listings#temporary) listings without adding them to your world store. 
	- You can use Udon to open listings directly, i.e. with [Store.OpenListing](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation#storeopenlisting).
	- You can't sell [instant](/economy/listings#instant) listings without adding them to your world store. In addition, only users who are currently visiting your world can buy instant listings.
- You cannot add [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) to your world stores.
	- Use group stores instead.

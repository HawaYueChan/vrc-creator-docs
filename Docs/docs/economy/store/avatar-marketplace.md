The avatar marketplace is located in the "Avatars" section of the VRChat menu. Users can browse the marketplace, search for published avatars, and see their [details](/economy/products/avatar#avatar-details). Selecting any avatar product takes the user to its details page.

Follow the steps below to publish your avatar on the marketplace:

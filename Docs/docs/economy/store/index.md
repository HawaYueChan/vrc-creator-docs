# Stores

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Stores make it easy for users to discover your [listings](../listings) and [subscriptions](../subscriptions) in VRChat. You can have multiple stores, and you can publish listings in multiple stores.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />

:::info

You can use [Udon](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation) to sell your published listings and subscriptions - even if you didn't publish them in your store.

The Creator Economy allows you to sell your content directly in VRChat, earn VRChat Credits, and pay out real money doing what you love. Whether you're an avatar creator, world builder, group leader, or all three, the Creator Economy gives you the tools to monetize your creations, engage your community, and grow your store.

This page provides a high-level overview of what the Creator Economy is, what you can sell, how it works, and how to get started.

## What is the Creator Economy?

The Creator Economy is a system built into VRChat that lets you do the following:

- **Sell [products](/economy/products/)** like like [world features](/economy/products/udon), [avatar access](/economy/products/avatar), or [group roles](/economy/products/paid-role).
- **Create [stores](/economy/store/)** so users can easily find and buy your content.
- **Earn VRChat Credits**, which can be paid out into real money.

You can sell content through three main systems:
- **[Listings](/economy/listings/)** - One-time purchases (permanent, temporary, or instant).
- **[Subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions)** - Ongoing monthly benefits sold through group stores.
- **[Stores](/economy/store/)** - The places users go to buy your content, like the avatar marketplace, your group page, your world page, or Udon UIs inside your world.

## What can you sell?

There are three product types you can create and sell:

### üåç Udon Products

Sell [Udon products](/economy/products/udon) that unlock features inside your worlds: Cosmetics, effects, items, access to special areas, supporter boards, and more. These are great for world creators and game worlds.

### üë• Subscription Role Products

Sell [roles](/economy/products/paid-role) for your VRChat group. Roles grant access to groups, group instances, announcements, queues, or exclusive events.

### üßçAvatar Products

:::info

Only approved avatar sellers can create and publish avatar products on the marketplace.

:::

Sell [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar) that give users access to your avatars. You can sell avatars in permanent listings, and they appear in the [avatar marketplace](/economy/store/avatar-marketplace).

## How do sales work?

Users don't directly buy [products](/economy/products/). Instead, they buy [listings](/economy/listings) in [stores](/economy/store/).

### üõç Listings & Subscriptions

[Listings](/economy/listings) are flexible packages that bundle one or more products. You can create three types of listings:

- **Permanent**: The user keeps the products forever.    
- **Temporary**: The products expire after a set time (like 5 minutes or 3 months).
- **Instant**: The effect happens once and immediately (e.g., spawn a pickup).

[Subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) are similar to listings:

- **Subscriptions**: Ongoing monthly access, only sold in group stores.

### üè™ Stores

[Stores](/economy/store/) are where users buy your listings or subscriptions. There are three kinds of stores:

- **[Avatar Marketplace](/economy/store/avatar-marketplace)** - Where all published avatar listings live.
- **[World Stores](/economy/store/world-store)** -  Attached to your world page. Contains listings.
- **[Group Stores](/economy/store/group-store)** - Attached to your VRChat group page. Contains subscriptions.

To maximize reach, you can add the same listing in multiple stores. In addition, you add stores to your world or [open listings directly with Udon](/economy/sdk/getting-started).

The chart below shows you how different types of stores, listings, and products are connected:

## Earning Money

Users buy your content with **VRChat Credits**. You can:
- Spend credits in other VRChat stores.
- Or, **request a [payout](/economy/payout)** in USD to your PayPal account.

### üíµ Revenue Split

- **~50%** goes to you, the creator.
- **~30%** goes to the platform users bought credits from (e.g., Steam or Meta).
- **~20%** goes to VRChat and its payment partner, Tilia (transaction and platform fees).


:::note

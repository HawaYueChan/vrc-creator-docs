## Payment Processing ##

#### What are VRChat Credits?
VRChat Credits<ThemedCreditIcon/> are VRChat's currency for the Creator Economy. They are similar to premium currencies found in other video games.
Users can purchase VRChat Credits and spend them on creators.
Creators can earn credits and pay them out in USD, if eligible.

#### What’s the conversion of VRChat Credits to USD?

When you request a [payout](/economy/payout), your earned VRChat credits are paid out at the following rate:

1<ThemedCreditIcon/> ≈ 0.005 US$

200<ThemedCreditIcon/> ≈ 1 US$

In other words, for each 1200<ThemedCreditIcon/> (≈10 US\$) users spend in your store, your [payout](/economy/payout) increases by approximately 5 US\$.

Please refer to the [Creator Economy Program Rules](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal/economy) and the [payout documentation](/economy/payout) to learn more.

#### What's the revenue split?

After paying out your earnings, you earn approximately 50% of what users spent in your store (excluding VAT).

Please refer to the [payout](/economy/payout) page to learn more

#### What's Tilia? ####
Tilia is VRChat's business partner for Creator Economy.
Tilia is a payment platform for accounts, wallets, payments, invoices, and payouts. As a VRChat seller, you'll be interacting with Tilia when [getting started](/economy/getting-started) and [requesting payouts](/economy/payout).

#### What payment methods are available? ####
VRChat credits are purchased through your platform's payment system, such as Steam or Meta.

Please note that VRChat Plus and VRChat Credits are not yet available on all platforms. Please send us [feedback](https://feedback.vrchat.com/) if there's a platform you'd like us to support!

#### What payout methods are available? ####
Tilia currently supports payouts to PayPal.
Additional payout methods may become available in the future. If you're a seller, tell us on [Canny](https://feedback.vrchat.com/creator-economy-sellers) what payout methods you would like to see!

#### How long does it take Tilia to process payouts?
Payout requests are usually processed within 1-2 business days. If your payout takes longer than 5 business days, please check your email inbox to see if it was rejected.

#### Why did my payout get rejected?
If your payout got rejected, it's usually for one of the following reasons:

- Your name on PayPal does not match your name on Tilia. Ensure that you entered your name correctly.
- PayPal does not support sending payouts to your country. Check your country in [PayPal's documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/payouts/standard/reference/country-feature/). 

When your payout gets rejected, Tilia usually sends you an email. Please check your inbox and spam folder for an email from Tilia.

#### Can users refund group subscriptions?
Yes. If users buy a group subscription, they choose how many months to buy in advance. If they purchase two or months, they can refund any remaining months, excluding the current month.
For example, if a user buys a 3 month group subscription, they can cancel their subscription and receive a refund for the remaining 2 months of credits. Transaction fees are not refunded.

## Products and Listings

#### How can worlds use the Creator Economy?
Worlds can use [Udon](/worlds/udon/) and [Udon products](/economy/products/udon) to detect purchases. Support for Udon products and the Creator Economy is [built into the Worlds SDK](/economy/sdk/).
#### What can world creators do with the Creator Economy SDK? ####
- Create Udon products on [VRChat.com](https://vrchat.com/home/) and link them to Udon products in your world.
- Unlock exclusive areas, items, or features.
- Open your store directly, making it easy for customers to support you.
- Create a list displaying the names of all your supporters.
- And more!

Visit the [Creator Economy SDK documentation](/economy/sdk/) to get started!

#### Can I use products from another creator? ####
No. You must be the content owner to use a product. For example, if you own a world, you can't use Udon products from another creator.

You **can** open another creator's store, group, or listing with the [SDK](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation#storeopenlisting).

#### Can I sell avatars in my world store?

Yes, you can add [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar) to permanent listings. However, you can't add avatar products to temporary listings, instant listings, or subscriptions.

#### If I sell a permanent listing, what are the support requirements?  
  
If you wish to continue to be eligible to receive payouts from the Creator Economy, you must make reasonable efforts to update your content for security, technical and other reasons, including ensuring compatibility with the latest version of the Platform and all hardware on which the Platform is available. If you wish to opt out of ongoing participation in the Creator Economy, please contact us.

## Miscellaneous

#### Am I allowed to make changes to my listings and subscriptions?

Yes. You may change listings, subscriptions, and the products they contain. Depending on your content, users may expect different types of changes, additions, or removals. This helps you support your existing customers and improve your content.

However, don't "bait-and-switch" users by taking away their purchases unexpectedly. Don't deceive users.

Some product types, such as [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), cannot be removed from a listing after any user has purchased the listing.
#### Do users have to be part of my group to buy a subscription?

Yes. However, if your group is not set to "Free Join", you can allow paying users to join your group by enabling the [Enable Free Join for Subscribers](/economy/subscriptions#4-role-permissions) setting in your subscription role settings.

Users can leave your group after buying a subscription. They lose access to their subscription role, but keep all products until the subscription expires. 

#### Can I split my earnings with another creator? ####
There is currently no split pay functionality. The [payout](/economy/payout) process is only available to the seller.

#### Can a listing be free? ####
No, listings cannot be free. Read our [pricing guidelines](/economy/listings#31-pricing) to learn more

However, for [testing](/economy/sdk/testing), you can purchase your own listings for 0<ThemedCreditIcon/> in VRChat.

#### Where can I provide feedback? ####
VRChat uses Canny for our community feedback and bug reports. Feel free to post on the Creator Economy section of our [feedback page.](https://feedback.vrchat.com/creator-economy)

#### If a creator deletes a product, will that automatically update/delete any listings that contain that product? ####
You cannot delete products that have any owners or active subscribers. You will see an error informing them that the product has active purchases and that it cannot be deleted. Instead, you may wish to delete the listing that the product is contained in.
